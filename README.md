Research paper about “Innovative Machine Learning Techniques for Accurate Diabetes Diagnosis”      
Diabetes is one of the world's most common noncommunicable diseases, affecting an estimated 537 million people. Diabetes can be caused by a variety of reasons, including excess weight, high cholesterol levels, and genetics. Patients who have diabetes for a long time may experience consequences such as heart attacks and kidney problems. Early detection of diabetes risk can improve patient outcomes significantly. This paper presents a sophisticated autonomous diabetes prediction system that employs cutting-edge machine learning and explainable AI approaches. We employ an extended dataset that incorporates a new, diverse dataset collected from multiple Bangladeshi hospitals with the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset. In our methodology, we use a range of machine learning models (Decision tree, SVM, Random Forest, logistic Regression, KNN), powerful cross-validation, explainable AI methodologies, and smart feature selection to discover which algorithm generates the best predictions. On the external validation set, the best-performing model—an ensemble of gradient boosting algorithms—had an accuracy of 85% and an AUC of 0.89. We also provide real-time diabetes risk prediction through a mobile app and a web platform. This research presents an autonomous diabetes prediction system constructed using a private dataset of female patients in Bangladesh and several machine learning approaches.
